## Max Path Sum In Binary Tree algorithm.

#### Problem Statement


Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its max path sum. A path is a collection of connected nodes where no node is connected to more than two other nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in a particular path. Each Binary Tree node has a value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively. Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the None (null) value.



#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: **O(N)**
- Space Complexity: **O(log(N))**


#### For example:

```python
Input:      10
            / \
           2   10
          / \    \
         20  1    -25
                   / \
                   3  4  

Output: 42
```
