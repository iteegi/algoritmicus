## Monotonic Array

#### Problem Statement


An array is monotonic if it is monotone increasing, or monotone decreasing.
Since a <= b and b <= c implies a <= c, we only need to check adjacent elements to determine if the array is monotone increasing (or decreasing, respectively). 


#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: **O(N)**
- Space Complexity: **O(1)**



#### Solution

Check this [Python](../medium/monotonic_array.py) code.
